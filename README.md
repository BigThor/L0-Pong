# Big Pong

... not actually any bigger, just named after my nickname **_Big Thor_**

This is a pong remake, made following the [course by CS50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfwpRU0cT10&ab_channel=CS50), using LOVE2D.

## Gameplay and Controls

The game is intended for 1 or 2 players. Player one (left) uses 'W' and 'S' to move and serves with 'Space', whereas player 2 (right) uses 'Up' and 'Down' arrows, and serves with 'Enter' key.

It is possible to play against an AI, selecting the option at the start of the game. AI is fairly hard but beatable.

In order to **win**, you must score 5 points. Ball accelerates as it bounces of off paddles, thus avoiding a stale game.

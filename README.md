# Big Pong

... not actually any bigger, just added because of my 
nickname **_Big Thor_**

This is a pong remake, made following the [course by CS50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfwpRU0cT10&ab_channel=CS50), using LOVE2D.

## Gameplay and Controls

The game is intended for 2 players. Player one (left) controls using 'W' and 'S', whereas player 2 (right) uses 'Up' and 'Down' arrows. 'Enter' key is used by both players.

In order to **win**, you must score 5 points. Ball accelerates as it bounces of off paddles, thus avoiding a stale game.
